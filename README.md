# To-Do List App

## Introduction

This To-Do List app is designed to help individuals manage their daily tasks efficiently by allowing them to add, edit, and delete tasks. The app includes a simple and intuitive landing page that guides users through its basic functionality. Unlike more complex project management tools like Trello, this app focuses solely on task management without features like calendars, alarms, or categorized task sections. It leverages local storage to save tasks directly in the user's browser, ensuring that no external database is required. This project is not yet proven in a production environment, but it has been tested extensively in a development setup.

### What It Doesn't Do
- **Calendars**: The app does not include a calendar or date-based sorting.
- **Notifications**: There are no push notifications or reminders for task deadlines.
- **Task Categories**: It doesnâ€™t support multiple boards, task sections, or project segmentation.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
To use the app, you will need a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) with JavaScript enabled.

### Installation
No installation is required. Simply download the project files or clone the repository, then open the `index.html` file in any web browser to start using the app.

### Usage
1. **Adding a Task**: Enter the task details in the input field and click the "Add Task" button. The task will be saved in local storage and displayed in the task list.
2. **Editing a Task**: Click the edit button next to any task to modify it. Save the changes by clicking the "Update Task" button.
3. **Deleting a Task**: To delete a task, click the delete button next to the corresponding task.
4. **Persistency**: All tasks are stored in local storage, so they will persist as long as you use the same browser and device.

## Next Steps and Contribution

This project is still evolving. Planned future updates include:
- **Calendar Integration**: The app will soon feature a calendar view to better organize tasks based on specific dates.
- **Notification System**: A task reminder system will be added, which notifies users of upcoming or overdue tasks.

## User Story:

As an individual with many goals, I created a simple to-do list to help me avoid forgetfulness. The app allows me to easily add, edit, strike out completed tasks, repeat tasks if needed, and delete tasks, so I can organize my daily activities and stay productive without missing important tasks.
